[Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) is a statically typed, open-source cloud-native programming language developed and supported by [WSO2](https://wso2.com/).

With Ballerina, you can easily develop microservices, API endpoints and integrations,
and any other application for the cloud. Additionally, Ballerina has all the general-purpose
functionalities you could expect from a modern programming language.

With Ballerina's compiler-level built-in support for widely used data types such as JSON and XML, your focus on handling structured data, network service interactions, and dealing with concurrency is made much more effective. 

Ballerina provides language constructs specifically for consuming and delivering network services. Its abstractions and syntax for concurrency and network interaction have been designed to correspond with sequence diagrams closely. This enables a bidirectional mapping for any Ballerina function between its textual representation in the syntax and its graphical representation as a sequence diagram.
